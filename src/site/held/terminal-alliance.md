author: Jim C. Hines
whyBlurb: >-
  Book 1 of the "Janitors of the Post-Apocalypse" sci-fi series: it's a light
  and funny read with a serious side. The humans who survived the zombie plague
  were discovered by the squid-like Krakau, who found a way to cure limited
  numbers of humans to serve as low-ranking troops in their space fleets. The
  story begins when a bioweapon leaves one ship's human cleaning crew as the
  only ones left to run the ship, discover a conspiracy, and try to figure what
  happened on Earth all those years ago.
cw: Mild to moderate violence; not much gory stuff.
