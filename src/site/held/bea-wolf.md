title: Bea Wolf
author: Zach Weinersmith and (illustrator) Boulet
whyBlurb: >-
  A glorious graphic novel reimagining Beowulf as a story about kids in their
  treehouse who don't want to grow up too soon. It's ostensibly for kids, but
  really for anyone who remembers what childhood could aspire to be. It's in
  full alliterative verse, and runs from the histories at the start of the epic,
  to the basic setup of the story, the many digressions and boasts as the
  characters engage with each other, to the book's conclusion at the victorious
  outcome of the battle against Grendel (or rather, Mr. Grindle, whose yard
  happens to be right under the treehouse). It is masterfully done, not just a
  single find/replace gag stretched out to fill a book but rather a full
  reshaping that deeply respects both the original epic and the dream of
  ultimate childhood freedom that it so beautifully captures, while often being
  laugh out loud funny. The illustrations are wonderfully detailed and
  evocative. (They are not by Zach.) The book is not terribly long, but it's
  lovely.
cw: >-
  Construction and electrical wiring dangerously not up to code. Grave danger of
  the risk of abrupt loss of childlike wonder and freedom. Excessive sugar after
  bedtime.
