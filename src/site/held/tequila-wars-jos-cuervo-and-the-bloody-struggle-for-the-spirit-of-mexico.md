title: 'Tequila Wars: JosÃ© Cuervo and the Bloody Struggle for the Spirit of Mexico'
author: Ted Genoways
whyBlurb: >-
  I have not read it yet, but this book was recommended to me as a good read and
  a wild ride of historic tales, from the lens of Mexico's most important
  alcohol industry (as many in a cruise state of mind might appreciate) and the
  larger than life figure that adorns one of its most famous products, about the
  history of a place (Mexico) we travel to on the Cruise, but are perhaps
  collectively under-educated on.
