  [Nonfiction] "Can we settle space, should we settle space, and have we really
  thought this through?" The authors did a remarkably thorough job of
  interviewing experts and digging into primary sources to figure out what
  challenges we'd need to solve before we can colonize space. They went into the
  project optimistic about how close we were getting. They didn't stay that way,
  but they take a fun and upbeat approach as they walk the reader through the
  many issues to consider. (Copiously illustrated with comic illustrations by
  Zach, who draws the webcomic SMBC. They should totally come on Boat.)
