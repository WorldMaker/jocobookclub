title: An African History of Africa
author: Zeinab Badawi
whyBlurb: >-
  Non-Fiction!

  15 hour audiobook


  The blurb sez: For too long, Africa’s history has been dominated by western
  narratives of slavery and colonialism, or simply ignored. Now, Zeinab Badawi
  sets the record straight.


  In this fascinating book, Badawi guides us through Africa’s spectacular
  history—from the very origins of our species, through ancient civilizations
  and medieval empires with remarkable queens and kings, to the miseries of
  conquest and the elation of independence. Visiting more than thirty African
  countries to interview countless historians, anthropologists, archaeologists
  and local storytellers, she unearths buried histories from across the
  continent and gives Africa its rightful place in our global story.


  I've not yet read it, but am intrigued by it.
