title: Catfishing on Catnet
author: Naomi Kritzer
whyBlurb: >-
  This book alternates from serious to silly to mysterious to ratcheting
  tension, as we get to know a group of teenagers and the AI who's secretly
  doing its best to look out for them. Come for the hilarious
  Government-Approved Sex Ed Teaching Computer gone wrong, stay for the lessons
  in just how many ways your online footprint can come back to bite you. (It
  might officially be YA?)


  Steph and her mom move from city to city all the time: so often that her only
  friends are from an online forum site. Unbeknownst to the world, the site's
  moderator is a sentient AI who loves cat pictures and finding subtle ways of
  helping people. The story becomes a near-future YA thriller when a threat from
  Steph's past shows up to endanger them all. (This is the AI from the lovely
  short story "Cat Pictures Please", by the way.)
cw: Teenagers in danger. Stalking. Psychological abuse.
