Blurb from a JoCoNaut:

> "Mouthwatering desserts! Family drama! Fantastic worldbuilding! And vampires,
> still a growing threat even though they technically lost the Voodoo Wars that
> society still hasn't recovered from. (Be prepared for a chatty first-person
> narrator, a slow pace, and copious loose ends. One of my all-time favorite
> books.)"
