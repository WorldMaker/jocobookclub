Blurb from a JoCoNaut:

> "2024 Hugo Award winner for Best Novel. In her speech accepting the award
> Emily Tesh claimed it was a book that she hoped would be quickly "forgotten"
> in the way that it tries to speak to hate groups today in the hopes that they
> go away or get better. It opens with a ton of CW warnings that are warranted,
> but it makes strong use of them. It reads like a part of the conversation with
> a lot of recent YA fiction such as The Hunger Games, and Divergent, but it is
> ultimately somehow both darker and, by the end, more hopeful. It's also
> something of a counter-novel to Charlie Jane Anders' "Unstoppable" YA trilogy,
> in a fascinating conversation. The book probably doesn't actually count as YA
> given the CWs, though. I think it could make for fascinating Book Club
> discussion."
