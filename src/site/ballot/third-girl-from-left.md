  Non-Fiction Memoir

  9+ hour audiobook


  The blurb sez: A moving, real-life account of making it as a dancer in New
  York City, embracing the changing faces of love and family, and being at
  ground-zero for one of the most fatal epidemics of modern times.... Wanting to
  be a dancer while growing up in a large military family made Christine Barker
  somewhat of a black sheep, but she followed her dreams to New York City,
  where-in a moment of almost unbelievable good fortune-she was chosen for the
  London cast of A Chorus Line.


  It was an account of the aids epidemic from a very personal viewpoint and seen
  from the gay community. I read it and recommend it
