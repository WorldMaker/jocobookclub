Blurb from a JoCoNaut:

> "Personally I adore their writing, but this book specfically because it is 1)
> first of the series, but does not end on a cliffhanger, so those that finish
> it and aren't intrigued, don't feel like they MUST read further to get the
> whole story. 2)It is an excellent blend of sci-fi/magic/superstition stitched
> together in a believeable and interesting way. Has themes of hospitality and
> found family wrapped up in a mystery."
