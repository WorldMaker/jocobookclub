Blurb from a JoCoNaut:

> "It describes the evolution of a completely alien intelligence, and has some
> great characters" "First book of the Children of Time trilogy. Advanced
> robotic ships are sent ahead to terraform a planet and prepare it for human
> settlement, but when the generation ships with the humans on board arrive they
> find that things did not go exactly as planned. A fun read, an interesting
> take on different forms of consciousness and intelligence (which carries on in
> the rest of the series). Arachnophobes might have a problem with the book."
