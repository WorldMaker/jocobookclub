title: 'Red Sonja: Consumed'
author: Gail Simone
whyBlurb: >-
  Gail Simone's novel length and shaped expansion of a character [she's explored
  in many comics as
  well](https://www.dynamite.com/digital/viewProduct.html?PRO=C1524112615=1).
  It's suggested to be a good introduction to the character and fits the book
  club's usual meetings a bit more than a comics omnibus might.
