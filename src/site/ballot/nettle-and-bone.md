  Marra, the youngest princess, was sent off to a covenant rather than married
  off to a prince. When she discovers what her sister has to endure at the hands
  of her husband, she decides to stop him. And that quest starts with tasks set
  by the dust-wife -- to weave a cloak of nettles and build a dog of bone.
  This is Vernon doing what she does best, with the juxtaposition of
  fairytale-ish events with down-to-earth personalities, and of dark horrors
  with kind characters, positive relationships and lively animal companions.
  She's very perceptive about the different experiences and concerns of women. I
  liked that Marra is a grown woman of thirty, not a mere teenager.
  “Fairy tales,” said the dust-wife heavily, “are very hard on bystanders.
  Particularly old women. I’d rather not dance myself to death in iron shoes, if
  it’s all the same to you.”
