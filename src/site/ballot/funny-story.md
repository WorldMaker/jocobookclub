title: Funny Story
author: Emily Henry
whyBlurb: >-
  Good contemporary romance by a popular romance author.  This one is one of the
  best of Emily Henry (IMO of course) with funny characters, situations, and a
  sweet love story behind it all.


  Daphne always loved the way her fiancé Peter told their story. How they met
  (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his
  lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling
  it…right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his
  childhood best friend Petra.

  Which is how Daphne begins her new story: Stranded in beautiful Waning Bay,
  Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s
  librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the
  only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles
  Nowak.
