  Friend of the cruise and benevolent leader of the Writing Track John Scalzi is
  best known for the *Old Man's War* series that made him (in)famous in scifi,
  but his first (self-)published novel is easy to overlook. Weird, often funny,
  including a long and elaborate fart joke sequence that can be both, it's an
  interesting glimpse into where John Scalzi's novel writing career has been,
  and a useful comparison to current silly fare like *When the Moon Hits Your
  Eye* and previous club read *The Kaiju Preservation Society*, because it shows
  that John has always been that silly.
