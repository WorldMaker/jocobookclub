- One vote per round per person.
- Votes can be changed until the round is locked, so persuasion campaigns are
  entirely valid.
- Voting is done with a Ranked Choice Vote, and tallied via the Schulze Method
  each round. Ranks (dolphins) will carry between rounds, but are not points.
- Books that receive low interest over 3 consecutive voting rounds may be
  removed from the ballot.
- Any Book may be suggested - even if removed previously!
- When suggested, an explanation must be given as to "Why We Should Read This".
  Failure to do so will mean the Book isn't added to the ballot.
- Only one Book per Author can be on the ballot at a time.
- An Author that has been Previously Read can be suggested again only after a
  12-month waiting period.
- When a Book from a Series is suggested, only the First Book will be
  entertained unless it was previously read in this Book Club.
